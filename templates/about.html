		My interest in web development started back in 2022 when I decided to try editing a resume
		template during the pandemic lockdown â€” turns out trying to center a div taught me a lot
		about HTML & CSS! Fast-forward to today, and I have had the privilege of joining a Bootcamp
		team where I have worked on industrial level projects, built and maintained websites for
		people and companies. My focus nowadays is on the Backend in Python - Django and JavaScript
		- Node. While maintaining a Blog where I document my programming journey in this competitive
		sector. With a few tutorials of new things I get to learn along the way.
