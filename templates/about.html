		Hello! My name is Albert and I enjoy creating things for the internet. I am Software
		Engineering enthusiast who is very eager learn and always ready to share my knowledge. My
		career goal is to become the person everyone runs to for a solution. My interest in web
		development started back in 2022 when I decided to try editing a resume template during the
		pandemic lockdown â€” turns out trying to center a div taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
		Fast-forward to today, and I have had the privilege of joining a Bootcamp team where I have
		worked on industrial level projects, built and maintained websites for people and companies.
		My focus nowadays is on the Backend in Python - Django and JavaScript - Node. I have also
		recently launched a Blog where I document my programming journey in this competitive sector.
		With a few tutorials of new things I get to learn along the way.
